1.  Factory - isValidSignaure will return the same as create signer

3.	WebAuthn - encodeSigningMessage compute presage which needs to get hashed
		Given data should be able to to produce only 1 valid message.

7.  Factory - Deterministic Address Calculation for Signers.
8.  Factory - Correctness of Signer Creation. (Cant called twice, override)
9.  Factory - Signature Validation (isValidSignatureForSigner Integrity)
